`happi` is an `R` package for modeling gene presence. 

## Installation

```
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools") # check that devtools is installed
devtools::install_github("statdivlab/happi", build_vignettes = TRUE) # install happi using devtools
library(happi)
```

## Usage 
The vignettes provide examples of how to use `happi` and all its main
functions through the `R` interactive session. You can follow the vignettes by running the following code in
`R`:
```
utils::browseVignettes(package = "happi")
```
An example snakemake workflow of `happi`'s usage has been made available under the `workflows/` folder of this github directory. To run the example workflow you'll need to install snakemake. We recommend creating a conda environment with your snakemake installation: 

```
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
conda activate base
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake
```

You can activate your snakemake conda environment and check it: 
```
conda activate snakemake
snakemake --help
```

Once your snakemake has been installed in a conda environment and activated you can download the contest in the `workflows/` folder and run the following to execute the workflow from within the folder: 

```
snakemake --cores 6
```

The Snakefile is customizable for your own input data and parameters. Please refer to the sample data files that have been provided in `workflows` for formatting of your input data.
